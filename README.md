# -CodeClause-_age-and-gender-Detection
This is a computer vision project that aims to detect age and gender from a given image or video stream. The project uses a pre-trained deep learning model based on the OpenCV . The model was trained on a predict age and gender based on facial features.

### Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You will also need to install the following dependencies:

# OpenCV
# NumPy
# Matplotlib
You can install these dependencies using pip, by running the following command:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Usage

### To use this project, you can either provide a path to an image or a video file, or use your webcam to capture live video. To provide a path to an image or a video file, use the following command:

python age_gender_detection.py --input <path-to-input-file>

To use your webcam, use the following command:

python age_gender_detection.py

The output will be displayed in a new window, and will show the detected faces, along with their predicted age and gender.
